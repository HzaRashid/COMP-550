- "character-based word representation model"?
- "dropout training"
- "transition-based dependency
parsing"


-Strengths: 


the choice of hyperparameter values depend on the language affects model performance under along with justifications of
final choice for such settings and their impact on the model performance.



- Limitations:
"Learning independent representations for word types from the limited NER training data is a difficult problem: there are simply too many parameters to reliably estimate"

- Intro:
In the research paper 'Neural Architectures for Named Entity Recognition', the authors proposed two methods for the task of Named Entity Recognition (NER). This research aimed to address the iss [insert goal]
