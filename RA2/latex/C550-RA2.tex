The paper, \textit{“A Structural Probe for Finding 
Syntax in Word Representations”}, by John Hewitt and Christopher D. Manning,
proposed a structural probe that tests a
language model's ability to embed syntactic information. In particular,
the probe was trained to evaluate whether syntax trees are 
embedded in a linear transformation of a 
neural network’s word representation space.
The (pre-trained, english) language models in question were ELMo (embeddings from language model, a BiLSTM)
and BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers), 
the latter utilizing an architecture not covered in class. The authors used 
the Wall Street Journal section of the 
Penn Treebank corpus to test each model's ability to capture
the Stanford Dependencies formalism. 
They utilized supervised learning on the dataset
to train the probe, namely the matrices that 
approximate the linear transformations.
To guide the research, the language models
were compared against baselines that were expected to 
encode features useful for training a parser, but not be capable of
parsing themselves. While the proposed method provided strong evidence
that ELMo and BERT capture syntactic knowledge as defined by the authors, 
it is limited by its strict formulation and reliance on annotated data.

The authors tested for syntactic knowledge 
in the form of parse trees, and
the probe was trained to approximate
linear (structure-preserving, matrix-form) maps
from a language model's contextualized word representation space to 
the spaces given by two metrics on the parse trees: 
a squared L2 distance encoding 
word distances in the tree, and
a squared L2 norm encoding depth, 
both measured in edges. Distances between pairs of words
are important for capturing hierarchical behavior, such as subject-verb agreement,
while the depth norm captures edge directions and imposes a total order 
on the words in a sentence. These intuitions are complementary 
in encoding the structural properties of the parse tree.
The authors used mini-batch gradient descent 
to minimize L1 loss of the post-tranformation squared distances and 
squared norms over all word-pairs and individual words in a sentence, respectively.
While this approach is minimal and provides concrete insights,
its bias towards the supervised data makes it prone to filtering
out other, possibly correct, syntactic details that are
encoded by the language models.
An unsupervised method can be useful for modelling such syntactic nuances
that are not present in the dataset. However, in this alternative,
it is difficult to make concrete hypotheses and observations about how
information is encoded by the language models. 


The authors probed three representation models: 
ELMo, BERT-base, and BERT-large. 
These were compared with simpler baseline 
models: LINEAR (from the assumption
that English parse trees form a left-to-right
chain), ELMo0 (character level word embeddings with no contextual information), 
DECAY0 (assigns each word a weighted average
of all ELMo0 embeddings in the sentence), 
and PROJ0 (contextualizes the ELMo0 embeddings
with a randomly initialized BiLSTM layer).
The models were evaluated on how well the predicted
distances reconstructed the true parse trees 
and correlated with the parse trees’
distance metrics. Given an input sentence, the predicted distances
were used to construct the minimum spanning (predicted) tree, 
which was evaluated on its Undirected Unlabeled Attachment Score – 
the percentage of undirected edges placed correctly
against the true tree. Furthermore, the authors
averaged the Spearman correlation between 
the true and predicted distances for 
sentences of a fixed length,
and macro-averaged the results
across all lengths from 5 to 50.
Similarly, each model was evaluated
on its ability to recreate the order of words 
specified by their depth in the parse tree,
and the Spearman correlations between
the true and predicted depth orderings
were averaged as before. 
A closely related evaluation metric ``root\%"
looked at models’ accuracy in identifying the 
root of the sentence as the shallowest.


As shown in Table 1 of the paper, 
PROJ0 delivered the best results among the baselines (but still worse than ELMo and BERT),
likely owing to its contextual representations.
The BERT models consistently outperformed ELMo, with BERT-large's $16^{th}$ hidden layer,
the best overall, achieving scores in the high $80$'s in the distance and depth correlations, and $90\%$ accuracy in root word predictions.
The best hidden layer of BERT-base
performed no more than $3\%$ worse than the best two layers of BERT-large
across all metrics, grounding the observation that the 
effective rank of linear transformation required 
was low compared to each layer's dimensionality, as shown in figure 5.

Overall, the probe provided strong evidence for the existence of a
syntax-encoding vector structure in both ELMo and BERT. However, the 
proposed methods were not designed to test particular syntactic knowledge,
but instead a strict notion where all pairs of words know their syntactic distance and ordering. 
Probing a model for its syntactic knowledge is crucial 
for directly evaluating its ability to capture the meaning of 
an input sentence. It can provide concrete insights that 
can be used to improve the performance of language models in a variety of tasks,
like word sense disambiguation and machine translation.
